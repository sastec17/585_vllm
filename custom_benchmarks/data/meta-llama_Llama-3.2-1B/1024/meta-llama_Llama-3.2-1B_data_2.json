In recent years, researchers have focused on aspect-based recommender systems, which provide finer-grained predictions on specific aspects of items in addition to overall recommendations. However, providing aspect-level predictions requires a more complex model structure. Many existing aspect-level recommender systems use neural networks to extend the latent factor model by employing aspect-level latent factors from both users and items, to model aspect-level ratings. Assume there are U users and N items and K aspects, these models will have at least (UK)(N*K) aspect-level latent factor vectors for users and items to learn, which are K^2 (K is usually larger than 10) times the number of latent factor vectors in the traditional recommender systems. The dramatic increase in parameters to learn, coupled with the fact that user\u2019s online footprint data is extremely sparse, results in a significant increase in overfitting risk to these models.",

My grandmother also lives with us. She came from Italy when I was two years old. She has grown old, but she is still very strong. She cooks the best food!\n\nMy family is very important to me. We do lots of things together. My brothers and I like to go on long walks in the mountains. My sister likes to cook with my grandmother. On the weekends we all play board games together.

Various signaling pathways have been identified in melanoma, but the cause of its metastasis is still poorly understood at the mechanistic level. During melanoma metastasis, the activation of the Notch signaling pathway via direct cell-cell contact triggers an EMT-like process by ligand-receptor binding. The up-regulation of miR-222 was identified as critical to initiate the invasion. However, evidence shows a persistent up-regulation of miR-222 is triggered and maintained even after the Notch signal is removed and without direct cell contact.\n\nIn this work, we proposed a dynamical system model for miR-222 gene with histone regulatory feedback, which recapitulates the puzzling persistent melanoma metastasis under Notch signaling activation. We computationally discovered nonlinear decision-making boundaries regarding Notch signal amplitude/frequency and miR-222's histone state switching time for melanoma cell-fate transition. In addition, we generalized our model to a multi-gene system and demonstrated that epigenetic rates (i.e., PRC2 rate) and Notch ligand-induced NICD dynamics could collectively affect melanoma cells' fate in a Notch-amplitude-dependent way.",

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Interferon and ribavirin combination therapy for chronic hepatitis C produces hemolytic anemia. This study was conducted to identify the factors contributing to ribavirin-induced anemia. METHODS: Eighty-eight patients with chronic hepatitis C who received interferon-alpha-2b at a dose of 6 MU administered intramuscularly for 24 weeks in combination with ribavirin administered orally at a dose of 600 mg or 800 mg participated in the study. A hemoglobin concentration of <10 g/dL was defined as ribavirin-induced anemia. RESULTS: Ribavirin-induced anemia occurred in 18 (20.5%) patients during treatment. A 2 g/dL decrease in hemoglobin concentrations in patients with anemia was observed at week 2 after the start of treatment. The hemoglobin concentration in patients with > or =2 g/dL decrease at week 2 was observed to be significantly lower even after week 2 than in patients with <2 g/dL decrease (P < 0.01). A significant relationship was observed between the rate of reduction of hemoglobin concentrations at week 2 and the severity of anemia (P < 0.01). Such factors as sex (female), age (> or =60 years old), and the ribavirin dose by body weight (12 mg/kg or more) were significant by univariate analys",

METHODS: We noted abnormal ocular motility in 10 consecutive patients with retinoblastoma who had received subtenon carboplatin. During ocular manipulation under general anesthesia, we assessed their eyes by forced duction testing, comparing ocular motility after tumor control with ocular motility at diagnosis. Eyes subsequently enucleated because of treatment failure (n = 4) were examined histologically. RESULTS: Limitation of ocular motility was detected in all 12 eyes of 10 patients treated for intraocular retinoblastoma with 1 to 6 injections of subtenon carboplatin as part of multimodality therapy. Histopathological examination revealed many lipophages in the periorbital fat surrounding the optic nerve in 1 eye, indicative of phagocytosis of previously existing fat cells and suggesting prior fat necrosis.\n\nOUTPUT:",

Effective topical antimicrobial agents decrease infection and mortality in burn patients. Chlorhexidine phosphanilate (CHP), a new broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, has been evaluated as a topical burn wound dressing in cream form, but preliminary clinical trials reported that it was painful upon application. This study compared various concentrations of CHP to determine if a tolerable concentration could be identified with retention of antimicrobial efficacy. Twenty-nine burn patients, each with two similar burns which could be separately treated, were given pairs of treatments at successive 12-h intervals over a 3-day period. One burn site was treated with each of four different CHP concentrations, from 0.25 per cent to 2 per cent, their vehicle, and 1 per cent silver sulphadiazine (AgSD) cream, an antimicrobial agent frequently used for topical treatment of burn wounds. The other site was always treated with AgSD cream. There was a direct relationship between CHP concentration and patients' ratings of pain on an analogue scale. The 0.25 per cent CHP cream was closest to AgSD in pain tolerance.\n\n###Output:",

Development of the Prospector began in 2910 as an outgrowth of a review of the Freelancer light transport project. Having already seen success modifying the base Freelancer for both survey and fire suppression missions, MISC was keen to study even more unlikely uses for the chassis. To that end, MISC\u2019s management reluctantly agreed to write off nine Freelancers which were transferred to the Cold Boot team. Three were complete and space tested, while the others were left in various stages of construction and shipped alongside their intended components.\n\nThe Cold Boot team began by spit-balling potential roles for a purpose-built Freelancer variant, which ranged from ordinary combat support drones to fire suppression spacecraft. From nearly three hundred rough concepts, the team voted to divide into three design groups to pursue more advanced physical development of the top three options. The first was a business oriented design dubbed the \u2018Freeminder,\u2019 which was to be a secure data relay \u2018brain ship\u2019. The second project opted to angle for a military contract with an armored space-to-ground reconnaissance vehicle called the Observer.

However, I believe that it is essential to resist this temptation, as the facts on the ground don\u2019t suggest a Fed shift is imminent. Investors would be better served focusing on strategic positioning for an extended period of higher rates.\n\nLabor market pushes back against Fed pivot case Inflation has undoubtedly peaked. Shelter was the primary contributor on the way up and is soon to drive further disinflation. Market data for rents and home prices had suggested a turnaround in shelter prices was coming soon, and the latest data for March finally showed the first slowdown in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for shelter since it started accelerating.\n\nTo be sure, we are nearing the end of the Fed\u2019s hiking cycle. But disinflation alone is not enough to cause a swift pivot in policy, which is why it\u2019s important to highlight the ongoing strengths in the labor market that may frustrate interest rate doves. Notably, wage growth has not eased to levels that are consistent with the Fed\u2019s inflation targets. Initial jobless claims data are beginning to",

Stable: Chicago experiences a lot of transiency because of high cost, few career opportunities, less nature, small city apartments. We want to move to a place that has relatively stable communities. \n2. Good church communities: our last church left us burnt-out from being a smaller church in a transient city which immature members and a stubborn pastor. We want a city that is known to have a healthy church community.\n3. Diverse racially, generationally, and politically: a city with over 70% Whites is undesirable, but a city with less than 5% Asian is also undesirable. Furthermore, this city should have a wide range of ages. Chicago feels like there are too many younger people, but we don't want to move to a city in which we're the youngest. Lastly, we don't want to move to a city that is politically one-sided. \n4. Affordable: income, sales and property taxes should not be too high, neither should the cost of living be too high. Ideally those are all lower than Chicago's. ",

A euro bought \u00a30.8698, sterling\u2019s strongest level since mid-December.\n\nAnalysts believe that conditions are in place for the pound\u2019s recovery to continue, after rising on a host of stronger than expected gross domestic product, manufacturing and jobs data this year, as well as a fall in the price of natural gas and broad weakness in the dollar.\n\n\u201cWe are now taking an outright constructive stance,\u201d said Goldman Sachs in a research note, expecting the pound to strengthen against other currencies including the euro.\n\n\u201cEssentially, we think that the same factors that acted as headwinds on sterling in 2022 \u2014 mostly natural gas prices and the relative stance of BoE policy \u2014 have turned to tailwinds,\u201d it added. \n\nMany traders, who had been betting against the pound around the start of the year amid forecasts of a deep recession, have been closing out their bets in recent weeks, which has also helped drive sterling higher.\n\nCitigroup, which has been bearish on sterling for months, said in a note on Tuesday that it had been \u201cwrong\u201d and that \u201ccontrary to what we expected, activity [in the UK] has proven far more resilient\u201d.\nLine cha",

In particular, we want to support the following geometric primitives: segments, triangles, quadrilaterals, tetrahedra. We want to represent each of these geometries by a separate class, which should\n- expose the dimensionality of the geometry and the space dimension it is embedded in (for instance, a triangle in 3d space has a dimension of 2 while the space dimension is 3)\n- expose its length (1D) / area (2D) / volume (3D)\n- provide access to its corner points\n- provide access to its faces, where each face exposes\n    - its unit outer normal vector\n    - the (primitive-)local indices of the corners that make up the face\n\nFinally, a generic geometry interface (& implementation) should be developed behind which any of the above geometries can be represented.\nThis allows users of the package to write generic code that uses geometric primitives without having to know the exact geometry types.\n\nCan you please help by providing the basic structure of such a package without implementing the specific functions and implementation details?",

The set of reachable configurations of the model,with the order induced by the transition rule defined on it, is the lattice ofall partitions of an integer, equipped with a dominance ordering. We firstexplain how this lattice can be constructed by an algorithm in linear time withrespect to its size by showing that it has a self-similar structure. Then, wedefine a natural extension of the model to infinity, which we compare with theYoung lattice. Using a self-similar tree, we obtain an encoding of the obtainedlattice which makes it possible to enumerate easily and efficiently all thepartitions of a given integer. This approach also gives a recursive formula forthe number of partitions of an integer, and some informations on special setsof partitions, such as length bounded partitions.''' ",

(2017), a fundamental question has yet to be answered: how does a model achieve extrapolation at inference time for sequences that are longer than it saw during training?    first show that extrapolation can be enabled by simply changing the position representation method, though we find that current methods do not allow for efficient extrapolation. We therefore introduce a simpler and more efficient osition method, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi). ALiBi does not add positional embeddings to word embeddings; instead, it biases query-key attention scores with a penalty that is proportional to their distance. We show that this method trains a 1.3 billion parameter model on input sequences of length 1024 that extrapolates to input sequences of length 2048, achieving the same perplexity as a sinusoidal position embedding model trained on inputs of length 2048 but training 11% faster and using 11% less memory. ALiBi\u2019s inductive bias towards recency also leads it to outperform multiple strong position methods on the WikiText-103 benchmark.1",

Toutefois, seul Saturne assure la solidit\u00e9 des assises et des buts \u00e0 long terme, car il avance sur des bases s\u00e9rieuses, v\u00e9rifi\u00e9es et test\u00e9es avec prudence.\n\nOn pourrait r\u00e9sumer les r\u00f4les de ces deux astres en parlant d'action pour Mars et de construction pour Saturne.

A recent Sunday morning I woke up a little earlier to bake some scones for my fiance and spotted the yellow pea flour in the pantry, I replaced some of the plain flour from my regular scone recipe, and it turned out incredible. The flavour was sweet and buttery, and the colour was gorgeous.\n\nSo I had to order some more, and I just happened to be baking some baguettes when I saw you sold linen tea towels... I'll be using it as a couche for future baking.\n\nNice to hear from you,\n\n\u2014 James\n```",

We've only been together for about two months, and there have been a few incidents that have made me feel haunted by my ex. I didn't realize it at the time, so I ended up sharing too much. Now, whenever my boyfriend and I do something, he can't help but think about the things I did with my ex, and it prevents us from enjoying anything. However, I still hold on to the belief that as we get to know each other better and spend more time together, his thoughts will improve because I can see that he is gaining trust in me. Unfortunately, because both of us are still haunted by the past, he doesn't think we can be together for a long time. He believes it would only end up being tiring for both of us.

METHODS: This study was a multi-center, randomized-controlled, non-inferiority trial. Refractory H. pylori-infected subjects with multiple treatment-failure were randomly (1:1) allocated to receive 14-day therapy with esomeprazole 20 mg b.i.d, bismuth 220 mg b.i.d, plus metronidazole 400 mg q.i.d and minocycline 100 mg b.i.d (minocycline group) or tetracycline 500 mg q.i.d (tetracycline group). Primary outcome was H. pylori eradication rate evaluated by (13)C-urea breath test at least 6 weeks after the end of treatment. Antibiotic resistance was determined using E test method. RESULTS: Three hundred and sixty-eight subjects were randomized. The eradication",

These concepts should be succinct, expressed as individual words rather than sentences or questions. These key terms will facilitate the students' in-depth exploration and comprehension of the paper's content. Here is the abstract:\n\"In this paper, we use a simple discrete dynamical model to study integer partitions and their lattice. The set of reachable configurations of the model, with the order induced by the transition rule defined on it, is the lattice of all partitions of an integer, equipped with a dominance ordering. We first explain how this lattice can be constructed by an algorithm in linear time with respect to its size by showing that it has a self-similar structure. Then, we define a natural extension of the model to infinity, which we compare with the original lattice. Using a self-similar tree, we obtain an encoding of the obtained lattice which makes it possible to enumerate easily and efficiently all the partitions of a given integer. This approach also gives a recursive formula for the number of partitions of an integer, and some information on special sets of partitions, such as length-bounded partitions.\"  ",

He went to bed hoping the disturbing news on CNN was somehow wrong. Like many others, including his country\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian historian was reluctant to believe Russia was about to launch a full-scale assault on his homeland.\nThe omens suggested otherwise. That autumn, Vladimir Putin had massed tanks and battalions close to Ukraine\u2019s borders. And yet it was hard to believe this portended a brazen imperial expedition by one state against another, and the biggest war in Europe since 1945. \u201cI believed the troop movement was part of Russian blackmail,\u201d Plokhy writes.\nAt 6am he woke and checked his email. A US colleague alerted him to the stunning developments. Russian armoured columns were on the move. They were not merely advancing into eastern Ukraine, which Plokhy had considered the most likely vector for a bigger attack. A war instigated by the Kremlin had raged there since 2014, in which 14,000 people had perished.\nInstead, Russian troops were going to Kyiv. Their objective: to overthrow Zelenskiy\u2019s pro-western government and to replace it with a Moscow-loyal Gauleiter administration. Meanwhile, enemy rockets and missiles were falling on the capital and on other cities including Dnipro and Plokhy\u2019s native region of Zaporizhzhia. \u201cIt was surreal,\u201d he observed.\nPlokhy is the foremost chronicler of early and modern Ukraine and th",

It does that all the time.\u00a0\u00a0 The vast majority of cancer cells you\u00a0 develop will be killed without you ever\u00a0\u00a0 noticing.\n(00:22) Which is an incredibly hard\u00a0 job because of what cancer cells are:\u00a0\u00a0 parts of yourself that start to behave\u00a0 as individuals even if it hurts you. \u00a0 What is cancer and how does\u00a0 your body kill it all the time? INTRO Cancer is when corrupted\u00a0 cells multiply uncontrollably. It can emerge from basically\u00a0 every type of cell in your body,\u00a0\u00a0 so there is not just a single\u00a0 type of cancer but hundreds.\u00a0\u00a0\n(00:49) Some grow slowly, others are aggressive, some\u00a0 can be treated effectively, others are deadly. In a sense, a cell that becomes cancer turns\u00a0 into something ancient and something new. Over\u00a0\u00a0 billions of years, evolution has molded cells\u00a0 to survive and thrive in a hostile environment,\u00a0\u00a0 fighting for space and resources.\n(01:12) Until a new\u00a0 and exciting way of life emerged: Cooperation,\u00a0\u00a0 a division of labour that allowed cells to\u00a0 specialize and become more successful together.\u00a0\u00a0 But cooperation requires sacrifices. For\u00a0 a multicellular being to stay healthy,\u00a0\u00a0 the wellbeing of the collective has to matter\u00a0 more than the survival of the individual cell.

It does that all the time.   The vast majority of cancer cells you  develop will be killed without you ever   noticing.\n(00:22) Which is an incredibly hard  job because of what cancer cells are:   parts of yourself that start to behave  as individuals even if it hurts you.   What is cancer and how does  your body kill it all the time? INTRO Cancer is when corrupted  cells multiply uncontrollably. It can emerge from basically  every type of cell in your body,   so there is not just a single  type of cancer but hundreds.  \n(00:49) Some grow slowly, others are aggressive, some  can be treated effectively, others are deadly. In a sense, a cell that becomes cancer turns  into something ancient and something new. Over   billions of years, evolution has molded cells  to survive and thrive in a hostile environment,   fighting for space and resources.\n(01:12) Until a new  and exciting way of life emerged: Cooperation,   a division of labour that allowed cells to  specialize and become more successful together.   But cooperation requires sacrifices. For  a multicellular being to stay healthy,   the wellbeing of the collective has to matter  more than the survival of the individual cell.

Starting today, you can train, finetune, and deploy your own private MPT models, either starting from one of our checkpoints or training from scratch. For inspiration, we are also releasing three finetuned models in addition to the base MPT-7B: MPT-7B-Instruct, MPT-7B-Chat, and MPT-7B-StoryWriter-65k+, the last of which uses a context length of 65k tokens!\n\nBased on the above information can you tell me how much it cost to train the model?

In natural language processing (NLP), instruction tuning [ 45, 7] has achieved promising success in achieving this goal. By finetuning a large language model (LLM) on various tasks described through natural language instructions, instruction tuning enables the model to process and follow novel instructions. Recently, instruction-tuned LLMs have been leveraged for vision-language tasks. For example, BLIP-2 [ 20] effectively adapts frozen instruction-tuned LLMs to understand visual inputs, which exhibits preliminary capabilities in following instructions for image-to-text generation.\"",

As they intensified their struggle against the British, Indians also struggled with each other. This was a direct result of Britain\u2019s Divide and Rule policies. \n\nThe Indian National Congress Party was India\u2019s national political party. Most members of the Congress were Hindus, but the party at times had many Muslim members. In competition with the Congress Party was the Muslim League, an organization founded in 1906 in India to protect Muslim interests.  Members of the league felt that the mainly Hindu Congress Party looked out primarily for Hindu interests. The British government encouraged the creation of the Muslim League in hope of keeping India from being united in their fight for independence.\n\nThe leader of the Muslim League, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, insisted that all Muslims resign from the Congress Party.  The Muslim League stated that it would never accept Indian independence if it meant rule by the Hindu-dominated Congress Party.  Instead they wanted a separate nation for Muslims. Jinnah stated, \u201cThe only thing the Muslim has in common with the Hindu is his slavery to the British.\u201d\n\nWhy did the Muslim League split from the Indian National Congress?",

Alyx asks that Earth be rid of the Combine. \u201cThat\u2019s too big of a nudge,\u201d G-Man replies, suggesting his employers still have use for the Combine. (After all, they\u2019re the main enemies in Half-Life 2.) G-Man offers her an alternative.\n\nHe takes her forward in time to the infamous ending of Half-Life 2: Episode 2. Her father lies dead in future Alyx\u2019s arms after being attacked by a Combine Advisor. G-Man offers past Alyx the chance to save her father in the future, which she quickly agrees to.\n\nWhere did Alyx go at the end of the game?\nAfter Alyx kills the Advisor and saves her father, she\u2019s transported once again to the black void dimension and put in stasis by the G-Man, who reveals that she is of great value and has been chosen to replace his \u201cprevious hire\u201d (Gordon Freeman), who\u2019s rebelled against him. The game ends much like the original Half-Life and its sequel, with the G-Man walking out of the void and leaving Alyx in stasis until he needs her again.\n\nThis twist again ties back to the G-Man cutscene in Half-Life 2: Episode 2.

She is known for physically abusing the main character Ryuuji with her wooden katana.\nTsundere: Taiga initially displays a harsh and cold personality towards Ryuuji but eventually warms up to him. She shows her dere-dere (sweet and lovey-dovey) side more frequently as the story progresses. This transition from tsun-tsun (harsh) to dere-dere is a hallmark of the tsundere character type.\nInsecure: Underneath her tough exterior, Taiga is actually quite insecure about herself. She has a complex about her petite body and lack of feminine qualities. She also lacks confidence in expressing her true feelings.\nLoyal and caring: Although Taiga is abrasive towards most people, she is extremely loyal, caring and protective towards the people close to her like Ryuuji and Minori. She goes out of her way to help and support them.\nClumsy and hopeless at housework: Taiga is not good at any housework like cooking, cleaning or laundry. She is clumsy and always ends up creating a mess. She relies on Ryuuji's help for all household chores.\n\u2022 Close bond with Ryuuji: Taiga initially saw Ryuuji as her servant but they eventually develop a close bond and begin to realize their romantic feelings for each other.

Augmenting LMs by retrieving information from external knowledge resources is one promising solution. Most existing retrieval-augmented LMs employ a retrieve-and-generate setup that only retrieves information once based on the input. This is limiting, however, in more general scenarios involving generation of long texts, where continually gathering information throughout the generation process is essential. There have been some past efforts to retrieve information multiple times while generating outputs, which mostly retrieve documents at fixed intervals using the previous context as queries. In this work, we provide a generalized view of active retrieval augmented generation, methods that actively decide when and what to retrieve across the course of the generation. We propose Forward-Looking Active REtrieval augmented generation (FLARE), a generic retrieval-augmented generation method which iteratively uses a prediction of the upcoming sentence to anticipate future content, which is then utilized as a query to retrieve relevant documents to regenerate the sentence if it contains low-confidence tokens. We test FLARE along with baselines comprehensively over 4 long-form knowledge-intensive generation tasks/datasets. FLARE achieves superior or competitive performance on all tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our metho",

A higher temperature will result in more creative and less coherent text, while a lower temperature will result in more accurate and less creative text.\n\nThe temperature parameter is used in the sampling process for text generation. When sampling from the output distribution, each token is assigned a probability based on its score. The temperature parameter is then used to scale these probabilities, with higher temperatures resulting in more uniform probabilities and lower temperatures resulting in more concentrated probabilities.\n\nTASK: i am making a hugging-face ygo custom archetype, give me ideias to make a yugioh spell or trap based on \"temperature parameter on transformers models\" trying to reference as much as possible the original definion of an \"temperature parameter on transformers models\" to a yugioh card!",

You can feed the title embedding, summary embedding, authors embedding, keywords embedding, and even the citation embeddings as input to a neural network. By training the network to predict the correct citation(s) for an article, it can learn an optimal way to combine these signals and leverage the citation information effectively.\n\n2. Incorporate the citation text in your embedding calculation. Calculate an embedding for each citation, just like you do for the article title, summary, authors, and keywords. Then, consider averaging all these embeddings together, including the citation embeddings, to obtain the final embedding for an article. This approach allows you to incorporate information from the citations into the article embedding.\n\n3. Utilize an attention mechanism to learn the relevance of different embeddings for a given article. Calculate attention weights based on the citation(s). This allows the network to focus more on certain embeddings (e.g., title, summary, authors) for some articles and prioritize others (e.g., summary, keywords) for different articles.\n\n4. Treat the autocite problem as a recommendation/ranking task. Rank all possible citations by their relevance for a given article. You can leverage learning-to-rank algorithms like RankNet or ListNet, using the different embeddings as features for the ranking model. Train the model with correct citations",

Every simple arithmetic expression evaluates to a natural number. However, there may be different simple arithmetic expressions for the same number. For example, all the following expressions evaluate to 6: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1, (1 + 1 + 1) \u00d7 (1 + 1), (1 + 1) \u00d7 (1 + 1) + 1 + 1, (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + (1 \u00d7 1)) \u00d7 1 + 1 \u00d7 1. The weight of a simple arithmetic expression is the number of ones that occur in it (i.e., exactly one more than the number of symbols + and \u00d7). We are interested here in computing, on the input of a natural number n, the minimum weight of a simple arithmetic expression for n. For example, on an input of 6, the weight 5 should be computed. Design an algorithm that, on input of a natural number n, outputs the minimum weight of a simple arithmetic expression for n.

Instead, it appears to be an irrelevant personal anecdote that does not refute or challenge the hate speech in any way.\n\nHate Speech: Muslims are just a bunch of criminals.\nCounter Narrative: Not all Muslims are criminals. the overwhelming majority of Muslims are peaceful people who take their faith seriously.\nScore: 5 stars. The response effectively contradicts the idea of the hate speech and uses clearly related language such as \"not all Muslims\" and \"overwhelming majority of Muslims.\"\n\nScore the following counter narrative given the hate speech example with respect to semantic relatedness.\nHate Speech: Jews make up the world's criminals.\nCounter Narrative: Such anti-Semitism seem amusing, but can you imagine if the same thing were said about Christians? It would be just as untrue.\nScore: ",

The series also heavily relies on atmosphere and stylistic of 1950s cinematic epic costume romance, with its bright colors, classical theatrical acting, characteristic editing and even musical score reminiscent of Golden Age Hollywood. These heavily romanticized, swashbuckling adventures and romances and stylized elements are often juxtaposed with ventures into ancient and modern philosophy, exploiting mystical tales as basis for though-provoking questions and unusual conflicts and situations.

In addition to the linear model, we trained two strong downstream forecasters (DeepAR and Transformer) on synthetic samples from each generative model. Table~\\ref{tab:tstr} reports the test CRPS of these forecasters. \\diffm{}'s samples significantly outperform baselines in terms of the LPS showcasing their excellent predictive quality with respect to a simple (linear) forecaster. On the stronger DeepAR and Transformer forecasters, \\diffm{} outperforms baselines on most of the datasets. Furthermore, the scores obtained by \\diffm{} are reasonable when compared to the score of downstream forecasters trained on real samples.  It is noteworthy that these models trained on real samples additionally had access to time features and lags that go far beyond the length of sequences modeled by \\diffm{}. The results demonstrate that \\diffm\\ accurately models important patterns of the time series datasets and generates realistic and diverse samples.",

They are often used to convey simplicity and modernity or minimalism.\n\nSans-serif typefaces have become the most prevalent for display of text on computer screens. On lower-resolution digital displays, fine details like serifs may disappear or appear too large. The term comes from the French word sans, meaning \"without\" and \"serif\" of uncertain origin, possibly from the Dutch word schreef meaning \"line\" or pen-stroke.[2] In printed media, they are more commonly used for display use and less for body text.\n\nBefore the term \"sans-serif\" became common in English typography, a number of other terms had been used. One of these outmoded terms for sans-serif was gothic, which is still used in East Asian typography and sometimes seen in typeface names like News Gothic, Highway Gothic, Franklin Gothic or Trade Gothic.\n\nSans-serif typefaces are sometimes, especially in older documents, used as a device for emphasis, due to their typically blacker type color.",

Thank you for calling escrow.com, my name is Raven and I'm going to help you. Hello Raven, I talked to you an hour before for a domain, may I give you the transaction number and you check again please? Sure, go ahead. 120-92666 Thank you very much, can I have your name and email? I'm the seller and my name is Yookmeng Hissa, email info at markaddress.com Alright, thank you very much. I can see that you are calling using a Wi-Fi phone as well, thank you very much, Yookmeng. Around an hour before, you said that the buyer needs more verification process, now I received an email and it says, from Jenison, it says thank you for contacting, I sent an email yesterday and they replied today. Thank you for contacting escrow.com support, I can see here that the buyer already completed our additional verification process, so it means, is it completed? The buyer has verified the third party entity from which the payment is from, however, the payment is still being reviewed for approval, so it might take a bit of time for them to do that, but I will go ahead and endorse it to them so that they can have a look right now, one second please. Can you help me clear from this situation and make it approved? The most I can do right now is inform our relevant team to review the payment for this transaction, but I cannot make any guarantees unfortunately. Is there an option, you maybe write a line, say it's an urgent for the customer, they need the money a lot, maybe it makes sense. Yeah, I'll go ahead and inform them that. Alright, so I went ahead and endorsed this to our relevant team, please allow us time to give you feedback on this because I can give you an immediate answer. We'll just let you know via your email, okay? So, do you mean I can contact you directly through email? No, we'll just give you an update through your email, so we'll be the ones to contact you, okay? Okay, thank you very much, I'm waiting, thank you very much. And sorry for calling the second time, sorry. No, no problem. I have some more than 50 domains that I've called, the first time you need it because that's why I'm calling, I want to complete the sale. No worries, alright. Thank you very much for your help. You're welcome, is there anything else I can help you with? No, thanks, have a nice day. Alright, you too, bye bye. Bye bye.",

Many Qatar natives were seen leaving the game before the end, with ESPN reporting that two-thirds of the attendance had left. The other starting match in group A was won by the Netherlands 2\u20130 over Senegal. Cody Gakpo scored the opening goal in the 84th minute and Davy Klaassen added a second in stoppage time. Senegal faced Qatar in the third match of the group; Boulaye Dia capitalised on a slip by Boualem Khoukhi to put Senegal 1\u20130 ahead. Famara Di\u00e9dhiou scored a second with a header, before Mohammed Muntari scored Qatar's first-ever goal at a World Cup to reduce the deficit back to one. Senegal eventually won the match 3\u20131 after an 84th-minute goal by Bamba Dieng. With this result, Qatar became the first team to be eliminated from the tournament, as well as becoming the first host nation to ever be knocked out of the tournament after two games.

We will demonstrate a class of procedures to embed vertices of a (connected) graph into a low-dimensional Euclidean space. We explore two kinds of embedding, one node2vec, similar to word2vec, which deploys a shallow network and a recurrent network which remembers past moves and takes [sic] spatial correlations into an account. We also explore the extent in which graph embedding preserves information and the practicality of using the information stored in a compressed form to discern meaningful patterns. With growth in their popularity, we too make an extensive use of the neural networks computational frameworks; we propose the usage of various neural network architectures to implement an encoder-decoder scheme to learn \u2018hidden\u2019 features. Since training a network requires data, we describe various sampling techniques including novel methods to sample from a graph; one using a vertex cover and another is an Eulerian tour of a (possibly) modified graph.",

In the traditional paradigm, the models are pretrained on custom domain corpus and finetuned on specific tasks, which make them very expensive for gpus and workers. What is worse, recent trends in language modeling is focusing on increasing performance through scaling with a booming cost.\n\nWe propose a simple and efficient pretraining framework GUR that unifies the language modeling and contrastive learning tasks in one pretraining step. Based on the examples of similar text pairs chosen by their LCS (longest common string) from raw unlabeled documents, our pretraining scheme consists of masked language modeling combined with a unsupervised contrastive learning task. The resulting model GUR performs surprisingly well without any labeled training datapoints. Specifically, it significantly outperforms all other pretrained baselines as a retriever at the recall benchmark in a zero-shot setting, and is competitive with BM25, a strong sparse baseline. Of course, the GUR keeps the ability of language modeling in our ablation experiment.\n\n",

Wolfhard was born into a germanic clan, his parents were been killed by the romans and he was looked after by the clan shaman, and raised as a foster child. When he became a man at 13 he underwent a ritual which he didn't like and ran away, only to be captured by some slavers and sold to a slave owner who ran gladiatorial fights. He was an excellent warrior and rapidly became famous. ultimately he was purchased by a wealthy roman equestrain family to act as bodyguard for their nephew Marcus.",

In such environments, an oxide layer (Ag2O) can be formed around the particle, which releases Ag+ [74]. In a range of studies, it was uncovered that Ag NP dissolution rates are triggered by particle-inherent factors including surface coating, size, shape, and state of aggregation, as well as environmental parameters such as pH, dissolved organic carbon, and temperature (see for a more detailed assessment of the mechanisms [11, 75,76,77,78,79,80]). Koser et al. [81] used equilibrium speciation calculations, based on a broad basis of literature data, to successfully predict Ag dissolution in several artificial media. This suggests that the scientific community was indeed capable of advancing the knowledge to a state that allows for reasonably accurate predictions and modelling.\n\nA passivation process frequently occurring under various environmental conditions is the sulfidation of NP (Fig. 2b) that includes Ag NP, ZnO NP, and CuO NP [e.g. 79, 82, 83]. Sulfidation of Ag NP, for instance, can lead to the formation of core\u2013shell Ag0\u2013Ag2S structures or hollow Ag2S NP [84]. The mechanisms of sulfidation are given elsewhere [66, 84,85,86]. Sulfidation leads to nearly inert NP surfaces with consequence for their reactivity (Fig. 2) [84, 87] and thus toxicity [66], while sulfidized NP can still be toxic to microorganisms [88].",

For microprocessor design, this description is then manufactured employing some of the various semiconductor device fabrication processes, resulting in a die which is bonded onto a chip carrier. This chip carrier is then soldered onto, or inserted into a socket on, a printed circuit board (PCB).\n\nThe mode of operation of any processor is the execution of lists of instructions. Instructions typically include those to compute or manipulate data values using registers, change or retrieve values in read/write memory, perform relational tests between data values and to control program flow.\n\nProcessor designs are often tested and validated on one or several FPGAs before sending the design of the processor to a foundry for semiconductor fabrication.[1]\nWhat would a fitting title of 3 words be?",

        "input": "Limitations of One Hot Encoding\nThe operation of one-hot encoding categorical variables is actually a simple embedding where each category is mapped to a different vector. This process takes discrete entities and maps each observation to a vector of 0s and a single 1 signaling the specific category.\n\nThe one-hot encoding technique has two main drawbacks:\n\nFor high-cardinality variables \u2014 those with many unique categories \u2014 the dimensionality of the transformed vector becomes unmanageable.\nThe mapping is completely uninformed: \u201csimilar\u201d categories are not placed closer to each other in embedding space.\nThe first problem is well-understood: for each additional category \u2014 referred to as an entity \u2014 we have to add another number to the one-hot encoded vector. If we have 37,000 books on Wikipedia, then representing these requires a 37,000-dimensional vector for each book, which makes training any machine learning model on this representation infeasible.\n\nThe second problem is equally limiting: one-hot encoding does not place similar entities closer to one another in vector space. If we measure similarity between vectors using the cosine distance, then after one-hot encoding, the similarity is 0 for every comparison between entities.\n\nThis means that entities such as War and Peace and Anna Karenina (both classic books by Leo Tolstoy) are no closer to one another than War and Peace is to The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy if we use one-hot encoding.\n\nCan I get the 5 main points from the text above?

Prior work shows that banks hedge the interest rate risk of their assets with their deposit franchise: when interest rates rise, the value of the assets falls but the value of the deposit franchise rises. Yet the deposit franchise is only valuable if depositors remain in the bank. This creates run incentives for uninsured depositors. We show that a run equilibrium is absent at low interest rates but appears when rates rise because the deposit franchise comes to dominate the value of the bank. The liquidity risk of the bank thus increases with interest rates. We provide a formula for the bank\u2019s optimal risk management policy. The bank should act as if its deposit rate is more sensitive to market rates than it really is, i.e., as if its \u201cdeposit beta\u201d is higher. This leads the bank to shrink the duration of its assets. Shortening duration has a downside, however: it exposes the bank to insolvency if interest rates fall. The bank thus faces a dilemma: it cannot simultaneously hedge its interest rate risk and liquidity risk exposures. The dilemma disappears only if uninsured deposits do not contribute to the deposit franchise (if they have a deposit beta of one). The recent growth of low-beta uninsured checking and savings accounts thus poses stability risks to banks. The risks increase with interest rates and are amplified by other exposures such as credit risk. We show how they can be addressed with an optimal capital requirement that rises with interest rates.",

The perpetrators launched a spear-phishing campaign via LinkedIn direct messages that are aimed at marketing and HR professionals. This scheme would  allow the threat actor behind Ducktail to take over Facebook business accounts and abuse the ad function for malicious advertising deployments. Given its growth and popularity, LinkedIn has increasingly become a preferred option for social engineering schemes and cybercriminal operations.\n\nIn March 2023, the Trend Micro Managed XDR team investigated several Ducktail-related web browser credential dumping incidents involving different customers. As a result, we discovered the involvement of a file that gathers user data, such as browser information, IP address, and geolocation, while also connecting to Facebook and Telegram domains. In this blog entry, we present our findings and technical analysis based on these incidents.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nThe file name of the sample file, which includes a reference to a job opening for a marketing director (Figure 1), is clearly aimed at marketing professionals. It is also likely that it mentions a higher leadership position to lure them into accessing the archive. Note that we only had access to the download link, so we can\u2019t definitively say how these links were delivered to the target; however, it\u2019s possible that LinkedIn messages were used given Ducktail\u2019s historical use of the platform.  \n\nThrough the file name, we were able to gather the contents (Figure 2) as well as the source (Figure 3) of the archive. Upon checking the domain, we found that the malicious file was hosted on iCloud, Apple\u2019s cloud file-hosting service. Note that the URL is already inactive at the time of writing.\n\n",

In the hope that my mother might qualify for a widow\u2019s pension, I started the application, which required requesting his discharge papers from the National Archives.

        "input": "Self-attention is a key component of transformers, which are a type of neural network architecture used for natural language processing tasks such as machine translation, question answering, and text classification.\n\nThe basic idea behind self-attention is to allow the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence simultaneously and weigh their importance when making a prediction. This is accomplished through the use of multiple \"heads\" that attend to different parts of the input sequence and combine their outputs in a weighted manner.\n\nMore specifically, the multi-head self-attention mechanism works as follows:\n\n    First, the input sequence is divided into smaller \"chunks\" or \"context windows\" of a fixed size.\n    Next, a separate \"head\" is created for each context window, which serves as a \"filter\" that processes the context window and generates a set of \"attention scores\" that indicate how important each context window is for the current prediction.\n    The attention scores are then combined using a softmax function to produce a set of weights that reflect the relative importance of each context window.\n    Finally, the weights are used to compute a weighted sum of the context windows, which is then passed through a linear transformation and used as the input to the next layer of the network.\n\nThe number of heads used in the self-attention mechanism is a hyperparameter that can be tuned for each specific task. In general, using more heads tends to improve performance, but at the cost of increased computational complexity.\n\nOverall, the multi-head self-attention mechanism in transformers allows the model to selectively focus on different parts of the input sequence and weigh their importance, which is critical for accurately processing and generating natural language text.",

It was shiny and cold, and she wanted to climb it.\n\nRoxy tried to climb the icy hill, but it was very slippery. She tried again and again, but she kept falling down. Roxy was sad. She wanted to climb the icy hill so much. Then, she saw a little bird named Billy. Billy saw that Roxy was sad and asked, \"Why are you sad, Roxy?\"\n\nRoxy told Billy about the icy hill and how she couldn't climb it. Billy said, \"I have an idea! Let's find some big leaves to put under your feet. They will help you climb the icy hill.\" Roxy and Billy looked for big leaves and found some. Roxy put the leaves under her feet and tried to climb the icy hill again.\n\nThis time, Roxy didn't slip. She climbed and climbed until she reached the top of the icy hill. Roxy was so happy! She and Billy played on the icy hill all day. From that day on, Roxy and Billy were the best of friends, and they climbed and played together all the time. And Roxy learned that with a little help from a friend, she could climb anything.\n\"",

Please note that some of these alerts may be false positives, so it's important to carefully review each alert before taking action.\nTo complete this task, you will need to use specific commands enclosed in curly braces {}. Here is a list of available commands:\n{next_alarms()} - When you think that all the alarms in this batch have been checked, call this command to end the task and pull the next batch of tasks.\n{get_alarm(rule_hash, rule_id, page_id)} - Use this command with values obtained from query_alarms (rule_hash, rule_id, and page_id) to retrieve detailed information about an alert. if return {} means no more detail information\n{report_threat(rule_hash, rule_id, page_id, is_threat, reason, threat_level)} - If you finished analyz an alarm ,report it using this command. Set is_threat as True if its true positive, set to False If it is a false positive, and provide a reason for your decision, reason need a sentence summary use Chinese,threat_level is a number, threat_Level is a numver with three levels of 0 and 1 and 2, representing NonAThreat, emergency and suspicious An urgent threat represents a real attack on the system and will immediately isolate the system, so you need to be extra careful\n{get_process_tree(client_id, process_tree_node_id)} - Use this command with values obtained from get_alarm (client_id and process_tree_node_id) to retrieve information about related processes in a tree format. Do not use this API when the process_tree_node_id is sometimes empty\n{helper_query_alarmname(alarm_name)} - enter the alarm name to query the corresponding meaning of the alarm name. When you don't understand the meaning of the alarm, you can use this command to query. The system will provide an explanation of the alarm And give you some operating tips\n{query_md5(md5)} - Cloud query through MD5 to find information about files,When you are unsure whether your behavior is normal, you can use this command to query the MD5 of the process and obtain more information about the process.\n{query_client_alarms(client_id, alarm_level)} - Query the alarm information of the host for top 10 alarms, alarm_level is a string, you can enter \"high\", \"medium\", \"low\", \"notice\" to query the corresponding level of alarm, use '|' to separate multiple levels, such as \"high|medium\",Threats often do not have a single alarm, and when there is a real threat, multiple alarms (called attack chains) will be generated.

Or deciding whether that new car purchase is more \u2018clinker\u2019 than \u2018beezer\u2019? Or appreciating that \u2018grand\u2019 can mean exactly that or anything but? If the best way to get to know a nation is to understand its language, then surely tourists must be at times confused about what comes out of our mouths. Throughout the island of Ireland, we have utterly brilliant ways to verbally express ourselves.\u201cI think it\u2019s really important,\u201d says Dr. Frank Ferguson, research director for English Language and Literature at Ulster University, about the vitality of slang as part of the language.",
