However, the core building block of Transformers, the attention operator, exhibits quadratic cost in sequence length, limiting the amount of context accessible. Existing subquadratic methods based on low-rank and sparse approximations need to be combined with dense attention layers to match Transformers, indicating a gap in capability. In this work, we propose Hyena, a subquadratic drop-in replacement for attention constructed by interleaving implicitly parametrized long convolutions and data-controlled gating. In recall and reasoning tasks on sequences of thousands to hundreds of thousands of tokens, Hyena improves accuracy by more than 50 points over operators relying on state-spaces and other implicit and explicit methods, matching attention-based models. We set a new state-of-the-art for dense-attention-free architectures on language modeling in standard datasets (WikiText103 and The Pile), reaching Transformer quality with a 20% reduction in training compute required at sequence length 2K. Hyena operators are twice as fast as highly optimized attention at sequence length 8K, and 100x faster at sequence length 64K.\"",

However, the architectures and pretraining objectives\nused across state-of-the-art models differ significantly, and there has been limited\nsystematic comparison of these factors. In this work, we present a large-scale\nevaluation of modeling choices and their impact on zero-shot generalization. In\nparticular, we focus on text-to-text models and experiment with three model architectures (causal/non-causal decoder-only and encoder-decoder), trained with\ntwo different pretraining objectives (autoregressive and masked language modeling), and evaluated with and without multitask prompted finetuning. We train\nmodels with over 5 billion parameters for more than 170 billion tokens, thereby\nincreasing the likelihood that our conclusions will transfer to even larger scales.\nOur experiments show that causal decoder-only models trained on an autoregressive language modeling objective exhibit the strongest zero-shot generalization\nafter purely unsupervised pretraining. However, models with non-causal visibility on their input trained with a masked language modeling objective followed\nby multitask finetuning perform the best among our experiments. We therefore\nconsider the adaptation of pretrained models across architectures and objectives.\nWe find that pretrained non-causal decoder models can be adapted into performant\ngenerative",

Normalize the data and remove empty values before training. Prioritize readability, maintainability, and ease of use over performance. Implement the model in a node backend and train it on demand. The minimum acceptable accuracy should be prioritized over performance.

All regular full-time IBM employees receive a minimum of 15 days paid vacation each year.  Your vacation time is based on years of service and type of employment. Full time employees: Full-time employees with 0-9 years of service are entitled to a maximum of 15 days of vacation per year. Full-time employees with 10-20 years of service are entitled to a maximum of 20 days of vacation per year. Full-time employees with more than 20 years of service are entitled to a maximum of 25 days days of vacation per year. Full-time employees are eligible for 20 days of vacation in the year of your 10th anniversary with IBM. For example, if your first date of full-time IBM employment was September 1, 1999, you would be eligible for 20 days of vacation beginning in 2009. You may take your full amount of vacation at any time during this year, but your full amount (that is, 20 days), is not earned until the end of the year.",

Memory has been a\nrecurrent theme in neural network research, dating back to early works (McCulloch and Pitts, 1943;\nStephen, 1956) and significantly advancing in the 1990s with the introduction of the Backpropagation\nThrough Time learning algorithm (Werbos, 1990) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural\narchitecture (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997). Contemporary memory-augmented neural networks (MANNs) typically utilize some form of recurrent external memory separate from the model\u2019s\nparameters. Neural Turing Machines (NTMs) (Graves et al., 2014) and Memory Networks (Weston\net al., 2015) are equipped with storage for vector representations accessible through an attention\nmechanism. Memory Networks (Weston et al., 2015; Sukhbaatar et al., 2015) were designed to\nenable reasoning through sequential attention over memory content.\nNTMs, followed by Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC) (Graves et al., 2016) and Sparse DNC\n(Rae et al., 2016), are implemented as recurrent neural networks capable of writing to memory\nstorage over time. All these models are differentiable and trainable via backpropagation through\ntime (BPTT). Parallel research lines extend recurrent neural networks, such as LSTM, with data\nstructures like stacks, lists, or queues (Joulin and Mikolov, 2015; Grefenstette et al., 2015). MANN\narchitectures with more advanced addressing mechanisms, such as address-content separation and\nmulti-step addressing, have been propo",

The primary objective of this study is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting water drinkability based on a specific set of input parameters.\n\nTo achieve this, various water quality parameters and methods were employed to assess water quality from diverse water sources. The collected data were then utilized in training a binary classification model, employing algorithms such as logistic regression, random forests, XGBoost, and SVM. Input features included physical and chemical parameters like pH, turbidity, total dissolved solids, and conductivity, alongside other commonly used parameters in assessing water quality.\n\nThe SVM algorithm achieved the highest accuracy rate of 82.3% among all models, demonstrating its ability to predict the binary target column concerning water potability. The most significant parameters in determining water drinkability were pH, total dissolved solids, and hardness.\n\nThe model's output can assist in making informed decisions regarding water quality and serve as a valuable tool in improving access to safe drinking water. Moreover, the model's scalability enables deployment online, allowing individuals to assess water quality in their vicinity.\n\nOverall, this project underscores machine learning's potential in addressing critical public health iss",

In this work, we\napply S4 to Machine Translation (MT), and\nevaluate several encoder-decoder variants\non WMT\u201914 and WMT\u201916. In contrast\nwith the success in language modeling, we\nfind that S4 lags behind the Transformer by\napproximately 4 BLEU points, and that it\ncounter-intuitively struggles with long sentences.\nFinally, we show that this gap is\ncaused by S4\u2019s inability to summarize the\nfull source sentence in a single hidden state,\nand show that we can close the gap by introducing\nan attention mechanism.\n1 Introduction\nThe Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) is the most\npopular architecture for state-of-the-art Natural\nLanguage Processing (NLP) (Devlin et al., 2019;\nBrown et al., 2020; NLLB Team et al., 2022). However,\nthe attention mechanism on which it is built\nis not well suited for capturing long-range dependencies\ndue to its quadratic complexity (Ma et al.,\n2023).

Naturalistic explanations have been consistently successful in accounting for\nphenomena previously attributed to supernatural causes.\nConclusion: Believing in the supernatural, including the existence of God, is\nirrational due to the lack of empirical evidence and the absence of valid arguments\nsupporting such beliefs.\n```",

In 2021, global credit card fraud losses were estimated to be $32 billion.\n\nThere are a number of things that can be done to detect credit card fraud, including:\n\nUse of an address verification system (AVS). An AVS is a service that compares the billing address associated with a credit card to the IP address of the computer making the transaction. If the two addresses do not match, it is a red flag that the transaction may be fraudulent.\nUse of a credit card verification value (CVV). A CVV is a three-digit code that is printed on the back of credit cards. It is used to verify that the person making the transaction has the physical card in their possession.\nReviewing transaction data for unusual activity. Merchants and banks should regularly review transaction data for unusual activity, such as multiple transactions in a short period of time or transactions to unusual locations.\nUsing fraud detection software. There are a number of fraud detection software programs that can be used to identify suspicious transactions. These programs use a variety of factors to determine whether a transaction is fraudulent, such as the amount of the transaction, the type of merchant, and the customer's IP address.\nBy taking these steps, businesses and individuals can help to protect themselves from credit card fraud.\n\nHere are some additional tips for detecting credit ",

Therefore, we need to form healthy habits to help us prioritise the most important things on that list, and to be able to switch off (literally) from work. I do this by taking regular walks with our dog, Nula, making time to get outside during the working day, and spending time with my family.\nI am encouraged by how much more we\u2019re talking about mental health in society as a whole, with sports stars and celebrities in particular helping to raise awareness of this critical topic. But I know there can be stigma around mental health, whether driven by fear, or misunderstanding. And all too often there is silence, when we should be having conversations. \nLast year we ran a workplace well-being survey in the UK with Mind, and we know that some Amazonians are nervous about confronting the issue, especially at work.

He was soon contacted by someone claiming to be from Discord Support by direct message, who informed him that his payment had been flagged as potentially fraudulent due to invalid payment information. Unknowing to Johnny, he was interacting with an imposter posing as a Discord Support representative. This individual used social engineering techniques to gain Johnny's trust and use his desire to resolve the situation, prompting him to provide personal and financial information that he would later regret sharing. \n\n\nWho Was Involved? \nThis scam involved a skilled cybercriminal acting as a legitimate support representative from Discord. The scammer appeared to be well-versed in the platform's features and protocol, which led Johnny to believe he was seeking help from a credible source.
